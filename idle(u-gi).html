                I'm on the ropes now, my arms are heavy<br>
                Can't let them break me down<br>
                Don't let 'em push<br>
                I hear the voices<br>
                Say I'm not worthy<br>
                Nowhere to run but dig deep<br>
                Hesitation got me against the wall<br>
                No more mistakes like I made before<br>
                'Cause I know how to win this time<br>
                I'll rise up like a giant<br>
                Hold my head a little higher<br>
                So don't you doubt me<br>
                When I'm fighting my lonely nights, I<br>
                Standing tall like a giant<br>
                Yeah I'll be going higher<br>
                So don't you doubt me<br>
                When I'm down in my lonely fights, I<br>
                Stand up like a giant<br>
                The scars in my heart<br>
                I'ma kiss you goodbye<br>
                Can't bring me down<br>
                You have no rights to say I'm no better<br>
                Feeding me lies<br>
                Leave it with your damn apologies<br>
                Won't be needing your same excuses<br>
                I can be hurt but I'm not afraid (not afraid)<br>
                Hesitation got me against the wall<br>
                No more mistakes like I made before<br>
                'Cause I know how to win this time<br>
